#PyPDF3

PyPDF3 is a pure-python PDF library capable of
splitting, merging together, cropping, and transforming
the pages of PDF files. It can also add custom
data, viewing options, and passwords to PDF files.
It can retrieve text and metadata from PDFs as well
as merge entire files together.

This project is forked by Michael Lelyakin from
PyPDF2 library for own develop and evolve this.

I will be very glade to see new contributors in this repo.
